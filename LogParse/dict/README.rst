dict: a stand-alone string/string associative array

This single-file implements a stand-alone string/string associative array,
similar to a Python dictionary or a Perl hash. The implementation is
derived from the Python dictionary with some additional tweaks and
optimizations due to the string/string specialization.

A demo is included and compiled with -DMAIN. Use the Makefile to
create a benchmark program and run it.
